          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm glad you stopped by my personal website. Here's a bit
            about my journey and what drives me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up and went to college in Indiana, earning a bachelor's
            degree with a major in philosophy and a minor in mathematics. My
            early career began as an adjunct instructor at Ivy Tech Community
            College, where I taught basic mathematics and algebra. However, a
            passion for music led me to Austin, Texas. There, I wrote and
            performed my own songs, and I had the opportunity to score
            commercials, documentaries, and theater productions. It was also in
            Austin where I met my wonderful wife.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our next adventure brought us to Cincinnati, OH. Here, I decided to
            go back to school at Cincinnati State and the University of
            Cincinnati, aiming to deepen my expertise in mathematics. During
            this time, I enrolled in a Python course and discovered my love for
            programming. This newfound passion guided me to Tech Elevator, where
            I earned a certificate in software development, setting me firmly on
            my current path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I am a full-stack software developer at a healthcare SaaS
            company based in Cincinnati. My work allows me to blend creativity
            with technical skills, solving complex problems and building
            innovative solutions. Alongside my professional career, I continue
            to teach mathematics part-time, helping students prepare for the
            ACT, SAT, and tutoring in subjects like algebra, trigonometry, and
            calculus.
          </p>
          <p>
            I live in Cincinnati with my wife and our beautiful daughter,
            enjoying every moment with them while pursuing my dual passions for
            software development and teaching. Thank you for visiting my site,
            and I look forward to connecting with you!
